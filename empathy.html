                Coming from a less-specialized background, I was also interested in how much people who were affected by prematurity in some way knew about all the research that was happening in this area. Where would a mother of a premature newborn turn to learn more about how prematurity would affect her child? In an age of self-service medicine, for better or for worse, anyone can look up information about nearly any disease. But how often do patients actually dive into primary literature? While working on LigerCat2, I wanted my work to at least begin to explore these questions.

                In addition to exploratory conversations with Dr. Sarkar about the researcher side of this project, I turned to Reddit support groups to reach out to mothers of premature newborns. I decided to use Reddit because of its engaged and active user base. I knew that if I posted on relevant sub-Reddits, I would likely get some response. For future work, I hope to be able to more systematically choose where I try to recruit people to speak to.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                In each relevant Reddit support group, I posted an introductory blurb about my work and asked for open-ended feedback. For those who responded, I would invite them to continue our conversation over a 30-minute video chat session. Because of funding limitations, I wasn't able to compensate any of the people who generously donated their time to speak with me. In total, I was able to engage around a dozen mothers directly on Reddit and have follow-up conversations with two mothers.

                As I was doing informal user research, I started to develop concepts for LigerCat2's functionality and user interface. I experimented with different interfaces, from a browser extension that would modify the NCBI website to a standalone web interface. I decided to move forward with a standalone web interface because I wanted to aggregate data from multiple NCBI data sources and doing so in a cohesive single interface seemed most intuitive.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                When deciding on the look and feel of the interface, I considered a dark versus a light theme. I ended up choosing to move forward with the lighter theme because I wanted the interface to emphasize accessibility and ease-of-use. I looked websites that might have similar goals -- primarily banking and government websites -- and settled on a similar lighter, more subdued palette.

                Throughout this entire process, I would meet weekly with Dr. Sarkar to review progress and ask any questions that came up during the week. Dr. Sarkar was especially helpful in guiding me through the more technical aspects of this project, including the code for extracting data from NCBI and developing the initial code prototype.
