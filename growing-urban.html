                    In addition to exploratory conversations with Dr. Sarkar about the researcher side of this project, I turned to Reddit support groups to reach out to mothers of premature newborns. I decided to use Reddit because of its engaged and active user base. I knew that if I posted on relevant sub-Reddits, I would likely get some response. For future work, I hope to be able to more systematically choose where I try to recruit people to speak to.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    In each relevant Reddit support group, I posted an introductory blurb about my work and asked for open-ended feedback. For those who responded, I would invite them to continue our conversation over a 30-minute video chat session. Because of funding limitations, I wasn't able to compensate any of the people who generously donated their time to speak with me. In total, I was able to engage around a dozen mothers directly on Reddit and have follow-up conversations with two mothers.

                Coming from a less-specialized background, I was also interested in how much people who were affected by prematurity in some way knew about all the research that was happening in this area. Where would a mother of a premature newborn turn to learn more about how prematurity would affect her child? In an age of self-service medicine, for better or for worse, anyone can look up information about nearly any disease. But how often do patients actually dive into primary literature? While working on LigerCat2, I wanted my work to at least begin to explore these questions.

                To help manage the scope and clarify the deliverables of this project, I worked with Dr. Sarkar to develop a week-by-week project schedule. Having a schedule for the project allowed me to concretely determine whether I was on-schedule or, if behind schedule, by how much. Starting the project by agreeing on a schedule also allowed me to be more intentional about how I carried out this project. I had read about the importance of human-centered design and about gathering user input in order build something useful. I wanted to make sure that this emphasis would be incorporated into the work.

                    Throughout this entire process, I would meet weekly with Dr. Sarkar to review progress and ask any questions that came up during the week. Dr. Sarkar was especially helpful in guiding me through the more technical aspects of this project, including the code for extracting data from NCBI and developing the initial code prototype.
